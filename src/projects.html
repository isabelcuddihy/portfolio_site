            <h2>Mastermind Game</h2>
            <p>Mastermind Color Matching Game challenges players to decode a randomly generated 4-color sequence within 10 attempts. Players select colors by clicking circles at the bottom of the screen and confirming their choices with a check-mark button.</p>
            <p>Developing this game posed unique challenges, particularly in leveraging the Python Turtle library. Working within the constraints of Python's standard library and the Turtle graphics module required meticulous planning and creativity. Overcoming these challenges involved extensive reading of documentation, experimentation, and conducting additional research to optimize functionality and performance.</p>
            <p>Two unique features of this project include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Leaderboard Integration: The game features an integrated leaderboard that updates in real-time after each session, showcasing players' best scores.</li>
                <li>Color Feedback System: Each guess prompts feedback in the form of hintsâ€”red indicating correct color but wrong position, and black indicating correct color and correct position.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Looking ahead, future possibilities for the game include enhanced user interface design, multiplayer mode implementation, and expanded difficulty levels to cater to a broader audience.</p>

                <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Building this game enhanced my Python skills and game development capabilities. The turtle library took some getting used to, but It has sparked my curiousity into researching other available libraries such as PyGame and Arcade. Now that I have an understanding of building a simple game in Python, I'd like to try to build something more complex, but use a different library.</li>

            <h2>Shape Image Album</h2>
            <p>The Shape Image Album project utilizes the Java Swing library to create and manage collections of images composed of various shapes. It reads information from a text file and translates it into graphical representations displayed in a user-friendly interface.</p>
            <p>During development, significant challenges included mastering the basics of HTML and SVG, in addition to Java Swing, to achieve the desired GUI appearance and HTML export functionality. This required a blend of learning through practical application, documentation study, and experimentation.</p>
            <p>Two standout features of this project are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pop-up Warning: A user-friendly pop-up warning notifies users when their image album at the beginning or end (i.e. no further images to view in previous or next buttons)</li>
                <li>HTML Export: Users can export their image collections to uniquely named HTML files directly from the GUI album, facilitating easy sharing and showcasing of curated collections.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Future enhancements for the Shape Image Album project include implementing dynamic shape addition to the canvas, akin to functionalities found in graphic design software like Microsoft Paint. This would expand user creativity and functionality within the application.</p>

                <li><strong>Unique Features:</strong> Pop-up warning for end/beginning of album, HTML export feature</li>
                <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Developing this project improved my Java Swing skills and understanding of graphical user interfaces. I also structured the entire project using MVC (Model-View_controller) architecture. Building it helped me gain a greater understanding of how the different parts work together and see the benefits and disadvantages of separating the tasks of each class. In the future, I'd love to add the ability to insert additional shapes on the fly or change the colors of specific shapes instead of uploading a whole next textual document. </li>

            <h2>BBC File Renamer</h2>
            <p>The BBC File Renamer project was developed to solve a business challenge of renaming thousands of caption files to specific and unique conventions for delivery to media partners. Often, the same files needed to go to multiple partners but with different names. By automating the renaming process, the project aimed to eliminate human-error from mistyping and drastically reduce the time required to rename large amounts of files.</p>
            <p>Key challenges included creating a simple terminal interface to allow other users to easily rename files based on the media partner's name. The program executes the rename function across all valid files in the designated folder after receiving input.</p>
            <p>Another significant challenge was integrating the archive caption project with this program to utilize a base filename standard and enable rapid auto-renaming of thousands of files to match the required style. The caption archive was successfully expanded to over 50,000 assets, ensuring adherence to proper naming conventions. Furthermore, due to many partners requiring specific numeric sequences in the filenames to like caption files to video files and other asset deliverables, the file renamer tool reduced human-error substantially and increased output speeds by 500%</p>
            <p>Future plans for the BBC File Renamer project include adding functionality for renaming video files, incorporating metadata tags, and integrating the program with a larger Content Management System (CMS) for instant export of correctly formatted captions.</p>
